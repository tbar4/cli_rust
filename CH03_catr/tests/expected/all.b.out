     1	The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.Don't worry, spiders,
     2	I keep house
     3	casually.The bustle in a house
     4	The morning after death
     5	Is solemnest of industries
     6	Enacted upon earth,â€”

     7	The sweeping up the heart,
     8	And putting love away
     9	We shall not want to use again
    10	Until eternity.
